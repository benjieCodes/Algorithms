        <h2>Question #1</h2><br>
          <h3>Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:</h3>
            <p>
              The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
              The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
              So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.</strong>

        <h2>Question #2</h2><br>
          <h3>You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.</h3>
            <p>
              Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

        <h2>Question #3</h2><br>
          <h3>In some scripting languages like PHP, there exists a logical operator (e.g. &&, ||, and, or, etc.) called the "Exclusive Or" (hence the name of this Kata). The exclusive or evaluates two booleans. It then returns true if exactly one of the two expressions are true, false otherwise.</h3>
            <p>
              Since we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't know how to do it), your task is to define a function xor(a, b) where a and b are the two expressions to be evaluated. Your xor function should have the behaviour described above, returning true if exactly one of the two expressions evaluate to true, false otherwise.
