        <h2>Question #1</h2><br>
          <h3>Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:</h3>
            <p>
              The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
              The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
              So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.</strong>

          <h3>You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.</h3>
            <p>
              Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.
